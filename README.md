## CS4287-CNN Assignment 2 by Craig Phayer (21340633) and Adam Collins (21332967)

## This project implements TensorFlows InceptionV3 and ResNet-50 models and does the following:
- import the following [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/archanghosh/yugioh-database)
- Train both a frozen and unfrozen versions of each model and compare there results
- Compare InceptionV3 vs ResNet-50 using cross fold validation (K-Fold)
- Compare Hyperparameters for each model to find the best parameters
